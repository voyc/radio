data entry form
  audio: composer, artist, title, time, place, description, source-url, media-url
  visual:          artist, title, time, place, description, source-url, media-url
  integrity check urls
  write to db

add to user table:
  musicset: blob, array of ids
  artset: ditto
  blocked_tracks: blob, array of ids
  blocked_art: ditto

archive.org urls and filenames are not consistent, so don't try to use their id
  page:  https://archive.org/details/BeethovenPianoSonataNo.1
  track: https://ia800700.us.archive.org/17/items/BeethovenPianoSonataNo.1/BeethovenSonata1_64kb.mp3

media cache idea - abondoned, too complex for multi-users

new svc: getRandom('track/art')
  read playlist
  if not found, create playlist as an array of trackids, shuffled
  pop the next track id off the playlist
  read db info for the track
  return as json to the caller

new svc: update('track/art/lit', sourceurl, mediaurl, title, composer, performer)
  insert or update, delete?
  need Account management
