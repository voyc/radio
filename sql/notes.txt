For now, we are adding new data into the csv file.
Eventually we will move it to the database.

filelist:

composer.csv - dumped from dads78s database
track.csv    - dumped from dads78s database
sql.txt      - notes on reading dads78s database

fixup.py     - one-time, convert track.csv to media.csv

media.csv    - master list for manual edit
csv2js.py    - convert media.csv to html/js/media.js
